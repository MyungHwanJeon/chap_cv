    ABSTRACT = {This paper reports on an active SLAM framework for performing
    large-scale inspections with an underwater robot. We propose a path planning
    algorithm integrated with visual SLAM that plans loop-closure paths in order
    to decrease navigation uncertainty. While loop-closing revisit actions bound
    the robotâ€™s uncertainty, they also lead to redundant area coverage and
    increased path length. Our proposed opportunistic framework leverages
    sampling-based techniques and information filtering to plan revisit paths
    that are coverage efficient. We employ Gaussian process regression for
    modeling the prediction of camera registrations and use a two-step
    optimization procedure for selecting revisit actions. We show that the
    proposed method offers many benefits over existing solutions and good
    performance for bounding navigation uncertainty in long-term autonomous
    operations with hybrid simulation experiments and real-world field trials
    performed by an underwater inspection robot.},

    ABSTRACT = {This paper reports on a system for an autonomous underwater
    vehicle to perform in-situ, multiple session, hull inspection using
    long-term simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Our method assumes
    very little a-priori knowledge, and does not require the aid of acoustic
    beacons for navigation, which is a typical mode of navigation in this type
    of application. Our system combines recent techniques in underwater
    saliency-informed visual SLAM and a method for representing the ship hull
    surface as a collection of many locally planar surface features. This
    methodology produces accurate maps that can be constructed in real-time on
    consumer-grade computing hardware. A single-session SLAM result is initially
    used as a prior map for later sessions, where the robot automatically merges
    the multiple surveys into a common hull-relative reference frame. To perform
    the re-localization step, we use a particle filter that leverages the
    locally planar representation of the ship hull surface, and a fast visual
    descriptor matching algorithm. Finally, we apply the recently-developed
    graph sparsification tool, generic linear constraints (GLC), as a way to
    manage the computational complexity of the SLAM system as the robot
    accumulates information across multiple sessions. We show results for 20
    SLAM sessions for two large vessels over the course of days, months, and
    even up to three years, with a total path length of approximately 10.2 km.},

    ABSTRACT = {Inspection of ship hulls and marine structures using autonomous
    underwater vehicles has emerged as a unique and challenging application of
    robotics. The problem poses rich questions in physical design and operation,
    perception and navigation, and planning, driven by difficulties arising from
    the acoustic environment, poor water quality and the highly complex
    structures to be inspected. In this paper, we develop and apply algorithms
    for the central navigation and planning problems on ship hulls. These divide
    into two classes, suitable for the open, forward parts of a typical
    monohull, and for the complex areas around the shafting, propellers and
    rudders. On the open hull, we have integrated acoustic and visual mapping
    processes to achieve closed-loop control relative to features such as
    weld-lines and biofouling. In the complex area, we implemented new
    large-scale planning routines so as to achieve full imaging coverage of all
    the structures, at a high resolution. We demonstrate our approaches in
    recent operations on naval ships.},

    in 2007, PeRL's research centers on improving AUV autonomy via algorithmic
    advancements in environmentally-based perceptual feedback for real-time

    real-time visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); (2)
    cooperative multi-vehicle navigation; and (3) perception-driven control.
    Pursuant to these research objectives PeRL has developed a new multi-AUV
    SLAM testbed based upon a modified Ocean-Server Iver2 AUV platform. PeRL
    upgraded the vehicles with additional navigation and perceptual sensors for
    underwater SLAM research. In this article we detail our testbed development,

    ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a unified approach for Expectation
    Maximization (EM) based motion segmentation, estimation and analysis from
    dense point cloud data. When identifying an underlying motion, literature
    mainly focuses on three related topics: motion segmentation, estimation and
    analysis. These topics are, however, mostly considered sepa- rately while
    integrated approaches are rare. Our approach specifically focuses on
    analyzing articulated motion from dense point cloud data by simultaneously
    solving for three topics using an integrated approach. No prior knowledge,
    such as background regions, number of segments and correspondence, is
    required since two iterations in this algorithm allow us to seamlessly
    accomplish integration of the three tasks. The first iteration of the
    algorithm is performed between segmentation and estimation, followed by the
    second iteration between motion estimation and analysis. For the first
    iteration, we propose EM based subspace clustering algorithm. For the second
    iteration, we simply fuse the motion analysis method from [1] into an
    iterative motion estimation algorithm. As a result, we can extract label,
    correspondence and motion of moving objects simultaneously from dense point
    cloud sequence. In experiment, we validate the performance of the proposed
    method on both synthetic and real world data.},

    ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the bundle adjustment (BA) between a sonar
    and optical image for an Opti-Acoustic sensor model. An Opti-Acoustic sensor
    model allows heterogeneous sensor fusion of an optical camera and acoustic
    sonar that have a mutual supplementary relation. There are two challenges to
    the Opti-Acoustic method. First, it is difficult to guarantee a common view
    from the two significantly different sensor field of view. Second, it is
    tough to figure out the correspondences between the camera and sonar image,
    since those sensors have heterogeneous sensor geometries. This paper focuses
    on the first issue by proposing asynchronously applicable relative motion
    estimation via BA. For the second issue, we propose using a Dense Adaptive
    Self-Correlation Descriptor (DASC) to establish correspondences between an
    camera and optical a sonar image. The proposed Opti-Acoustic BA is validated
    through autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) simultaneous localization and

    ABSTRACT = {Underwater images captured in a turbid medium often suffer from
    significant degradation of visibility. Conven- tional dehazing approaches
    focus on dehazing a single image by using multiple channels for color
    restoration and rarely consider computational efficiency. This paper
    proposes an online dehazing method with sparse depth priors using an
    incremental Gaussian Process (iGP). The main contribution of this paper is
    developing a practically usable dehazing method for underwater robots using
    incoming sparse depth priors (range measurements) from any calibrated depth
    sensors. To deal with incoming depth priors efficiently, we adopt iGP for
    incremental depth map estimation and dehazing. Because the input vector of
    the iGP model is easily reconfigured, we can use the same update method for
    both color and gray images. Our method also estimates color-balanced veiling
    light to compensate for the color attenuation problem. For the evaluation,
    we first verify the proposed method on a open RGBD dataset and test it on
    real underwater color and gray images, comparing the results with those of
    previous methods.},

    model for imaging sonar. To overcome limited sensor information for

    in the imaging mode to provide spatial constraints when a scene is
    revisited. Unlike terrestrial images, sonar images are usually low res-
    olution with highly speckled noise. We found that exploiting features from
    nonlinear scale space improves feature detection. In this paper, we adopt
    KAZE features and use random sample consensus (RANSAC) to refine
    correspondences. Using these correspondences, we propose point-based
    relative pose estimation via bundle adjustment. The target application that
    this work focuses on is underwater seafloor mapping, and the proposed model
    assumes a fixed elevation. Through this work, we present (i) validation of
    nonlinear scale space features for sonar images and (ii) proposal of a sonar
    sensor measurement model for underwater simultaneous localization and

    The former is important in measuring an overall global saliency map for a
    given area, and is motivated from inverse document frequency (a measure of
    rarity) in information retrieval. Local saliency is defined by computing the
    entropy of the bag-of-words histogram, and is useful to avoid adding
    visually benign key frames to the map. The two different metrics are

    ABSTRACT = {This paper discusses an approach to using the Cramer Rao Lower
    Bound (CRLB) as a trajectory design tool for autonomous underwater vehicle
    (AUV) visual navigation. We begin with a discussion of Fisher Information as
    a measure of the lower bound of uncertainty in a simultaneous localization
    and mapping (SLAM) pose-graph. Treating the AUV trajectory as an non-random
    parameter, the Fisher information is calculated from the CRLB derivation,
    and depends only upon path geometry and sensor noise. The effect of the
    trajectory design parameters are evaluated by calculating the CRLB with
    different parameter sets. Next, optimal survey parameters are selected to
    improve the overall coverage rate while maintaining an acceptable level of
    localization precision for a fixed number of pose samples. The utility of
    the CRLB as a design tool in pre-planning an AUV survey is demonstrated
    using a synthetic data set for a boustrophedon survey. In this
    demonstration, we compare the CRLB of the improved survey plan with that of
    an actual previous hull-inspection survey plan of the USS Saratoga. Survey
    optimality is evaluated by measuring the overall coverage area and CRLB
    localization precision for a fixed number of nodes in the graph. We also
    examine how to exploit prior knowledge of environmental feature distribution
    in the survey plan.},

    ABSTRACT = {This paper reports the application of vision based simultaneous
    localization and mapping (SLAM) to the problem of autonomous ship hull
    inspection by an underwater vehicle. The goal of this work is to
    automatically map and navigate the underwater surface area of a ship hull
    for foreign object detection and maintenance inspection tasks. For this
    purpose we employ a pose-graph SLAM algorithm using an extended information
    filter for inference. For perception, we use a calibrated monocular camera
    system mounted on a tilt actuator so that the camera approximately maintains
    a nadir view to the hull. A combination of SIFT and Harris features
    detectors are used within a pairwise image registration framework to provide
    camera-derived relative-pose constraints (modulo scale). Because the ship
    hull surface can vary from being locally planar to highly three-dimensional
    (e.g., screws, rudder), we employ a geometric model selection framework to
    appropriately choose either an essential matrix or homography registration
    model during image registration. This allows the image registration engine
    to exploit geometry information at the early stages of estimation, which
    results in better navigation and structure reconstruction via more accurate
    and robust cameraconstraints. Preliminary results are reported for mapping a
    1,300 image data set covering a 30 m by 5 m section of the hull of a USS
    aircraft carrier. The post-processed result validates the algorithm's
    potential to provide in-situ navigation in the underwater environment for
    trajectory control, while generating a texture-mapped 3D model of the ship
    hull as a by-product for inspection.},

    bottom-lock velocity measurements, a KVH single-axis fiber-optic gyroscope
    for yaw rate, and a WHOI Micromodem for communication, along with other
    sensor packages discussed forthwith. To accommodate the additional sensor
    payload, a new Delrin nose cone was designed and fabricated. Additional
    32-bit embedded CPU hardware was added for data-logging, realtime control,
    and in-situ real-time SLAM algorithm testing and validation. Details of the

      underwater vehicle (AUV) research projects being pursued within the
      Perceptual Robotics Laboratory (PeRL) at the University of Michigan.
      Founded in 2007, PeRL's research thrust is centered around improving AUV
      autonomy via algorithmic advancements in sensor-driven perceptual feedback
      for environmentally-based real-time mapping, navigation, and control. In
      this paper we discuss our three major research areas of: (1) real-time
      visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM); (2) cooperative
      multi-vehicle navigation; and (3) perception-driven control. Pursuant to
      these research objectives, PeRL has acquired and significantly modified
      two commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) Ocean-Server Technology, Inc. Iver2
      AUV platforms to serve as a real-world engineering testbed for algorithm
      development and validation. Details of the design modification, and
